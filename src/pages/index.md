        One of the fundamental bases for the correct execution of an industrial project is to have an
        expeditious documentation, both at the level of plans as well as the intrinsic information of the
        project itself. For professionals in charge of managing and maintaining industrial infrastructures, it is of particular importance to have documentation that is a reliable reflection of what exists within the structure of the plant.In this particular either an update of plans or a development from scratch, the professionals that integrate VeneHindustrial are ready to extend the solution that directly aligns with your needs.

        It is well known that both at industrial and commercial level, one of the factors that plays a
        relevant role in the power supply of electrical/electronic/control systems is the quality of the
        power. Certain levels of harmonic distortion in both current and voltage signals can have
        catastrophic consequences in the medium/long term (line overheating, disturbances in certain types
        of equipment, increase in the payment of electric bills due to reactive energy, etc.). Being able
        to count on equipment for monitoring the electrical variables of your electrical system that is
        simple to install, easy to handle and user friendly to configure is one of the initial steps
        through which an analysis of the power quality conditions can be made.

        An electromagnetic interference (EMI) is the phenomenon in which two or more waves merge to form a
        resulting wave of greater, lesser or equal size than the waves that
        compose it, being in any case the resulting wave different from the original ones and therefore
        perhaps unsuitable for its function. Electromagnetic interferences are the disturbances that occur
        in any circuit, component or electronic system due to the presence of unwanted voltages or
        currents, caused by internal or external radiation coming from radiated signals from electric
        motors, high power electrical lines, radio stations. For the particular type of conducted
        Electromagnetic Interference (conducted through the physical links of the wiring) for the various
        environments where electrical power systems are used, VeneHindustrial is able to design and install
        elements in the feeder cables of the system that lead to eliminate the presence of such electromagnetic interference. What is achieved with this? To reduce the cost of the energy as well as to help in the global effect to the reduction of C02 towards the environment.

        In general, to monitor the temperature conditions in the electrical panels in order to detect any 
        possible failure in the relevant connection points of the electrical loads involves the use of 
        thermographic devices or cameras. It is also feasible to use other types of equipment immersed in 
        the metal-mechanical structure of these panels. The technological solution in which 
        VeneHindustrial is qualified to execute an integration is represented by elements that are 
        installed both in the vicinity of the power bars of the panel as well as in the cubicles that 
        execute the derivation of currents towards the different loads in the field. This cost/effective 
        solution is already implemented by the great manufacturers of electrical panels at world-wide 
        level.
