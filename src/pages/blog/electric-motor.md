An electric motor is a device used to convert electricity into mechanical energyâ€”opposite to an electric generator. They operate using principles of electromagnetism, which shows that a force is applied when an electric current is present in a magnetic field. This force creates a torque on a loop of wire present in the magnetic field, which causes the motor to spin and perform useful work. Motors are used in a wide range of applications, such as fans, power tools, appliances, electric vehicles, and hybrid cars. 

## Induction Motor

The simplest type of induction motor is shown in cross section in the figure. A three-phase set of stator windings is inserted in slots in the stator iron. These windings may be connected either in a wye configuration, normally without external connection to the neutral point, or in a delta configuration. The rotor consists of a cylindrical iron core with conductors placed in slots around the surface. In the most usual form, these rotor conductors are connected together at each end of the rotor by a conducting end ring.

### Who are work?

Motors have many different working parts in order for them to continually rotate, providing power as needed. Motors can run off of direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), and both have their benefits and drawbacks. For the purpose of this article a DC motor will be analyzed:

The main parts of a DC motor include:

    Stator: The stationary part of the motor, specifically the magnet. Electromagnets are often used in order to provide more power.

    Rotor: The coil that is mounted on an axle and spins at high speeds, providing rotational mechanical energy to the system.

    Commutator: This component is key in DC motors,  Without it, the rotor would not be able to spin continuously due to opposing forces created by the changing current. The commutator allows the rotor to spin by reversing the current each time the coil does a half turn.

    Power source: Supplies an electromotive force which causes current to flow in the system.

    Brushes: These are connected to the terminals of the power source, allowing electric power to flow into the commutator.
