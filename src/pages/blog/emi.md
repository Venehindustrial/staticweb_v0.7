  Electromagnetic Interference is a very important factor that must be considered when integrating any type of equipment into systems which may be susceptible to the effect of electromagnetic interference or which, due to certain construction conditions, do not comply with the corresponding international standards.

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a phenomenon that may occur when an electronic device is exposed to an
electromagnetic (EM) field. Any device that has electronic circuitry can be susceptible to EMI. With the
ever-increasing use of the electromagnetic spectrum and the more complex and sophisticated electronic devices,
issues of EMI are attracting attention. When addressing EMI issues, consider a source, a path, and a receptor.
The electromagnetic energy from the source propagates through the path and interferes with the operation of
the receptor. All three must exist to have an EMI problem. The path can be conducted, radiated, inductive, or
coupled with a capacitor or with electrostatic discharges, or a combination of any of the above. Therefore, to
understand the effects of EMI, consider two factors: Emissions and immunity (also known as susceptibility).


## What are Emission?

Emissions are a measure of electromagnetic energy from a radiofrequency source. Immunity concerns the degree
of interference from an external electromagnetic energy source on the operation of the electronic device. The
device will be immune below a certain level of EMI and become susceptible above that level. The three most
common EMI problems are radio frequency interference, electrostatic discharge, and power disturbances. This
chapter will focus on radiated interference from various radiofrequency sources.

### What is EMC?

The threat of EMI is controlled by adopting the practices of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). This is
defined as, “The ability of a device, unit of equipment, or system to function satisfactorily in its
electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that
environment.” The term EMC has two complementary aspects: it describes the ability of electrical and
electronic systems to operate without interfering with other systems, and it describes the ability of such
systems to operate as intended within a specified electromagnetic environment.
