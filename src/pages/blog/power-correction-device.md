meta_title: Improve the power quality
meta_description: >-
  All modern electronic devices are vulnerable to the poor power quality. But why? What can you do about it? This technical article describes 12 types of power correction devices (16 in total) that accept electrical power in whatever form it is available and modify the power to improve the quality or reliability required for electronic AC equipment.

## Why power Correction?

Power factor correction (PFC) aims to improve power factor, and therefore power quality. It reduces the load 
on the electrical distribution system, increases energy efficiency and reduces electricity costs. It also 
decreases the likelihood of instability and failure of equipment. There are devices that perform functions 
such as the elimination of noise, change, or stabilization of voltage, 
frecuency, and waveform.

The job of selecting the appropriate power correction device is fairly straightforward when it powers a single 
load. The requirements of only one load need to be considered. For larger systems that support many loads, the
requirements of all loads need to be considered, as well as the potential interactions between them, to decide
the appropriate enhancement equipment and system construction.

## Devices for improve the Power Factor

Below we present a set of devices through which it is feasible to implement power factor correction:

1.- Isolation transformers

2.- Noise filters

3.- Harmonic current solutions (Passive harmonic filter, Phase-shifting transformers, Active harmonic filter).

4.- Trasiente voltage surge suppresion.

5.- Voltage Regulators (Tap Changers, Buck Boost, Ferroresonante constant voltage transformers).

6.- Power Lines conditioners.

7.- Computer power distribution units.

8.- Magnetic Synthetizer.

9.- Motor - Alternator / Generator.

10.- Static transfer switches (STSs).

11.- Standby power systems (SPSs).

12.- Uninterrunpible power supplies (UPSs)

Some manufacturers take advantage of the extensive capability of some of the conditioners, such as the
ferroresonant transformer, magnetic synthesizer, and M-G. The filtering capability allows them to use a very
simple inverter circuit that generates square waves as opposed to sine waves. The line conditioner is in
circuit all the time and provides conditioning of the inverter output as well as the utility during normal
operation. Continuous regulated output power can be achieved by this method if the line conditioner has
sufficient ride-through to power the load during the interruption time.
