## Who we are?

VeneHindustrial was born in Argentina in mid-2019 with the fundamental objective of being a company
dedicated to the development of Engineering projects in the mechanical, electrical, electronic and
automation sectors for the Industrial sector. We have a team of professionals and collaborators who have
extensive experience in developing engineering for important companies in the Oil&Gas, Steel, Utility,
manufacturing and Railway sectors.

## Why do we do what we do? 

For any person or company that has the possibility to listen to the needs that a business organization has
in the present or in its future, it is a benefit and much more if it has the possibility of presenting a
viable solution to said need. From our point of view it is not just a benefit, it goes further, we
perceive it as a joy since it gives us the invaluable opportunity to analyze the situation, visualize all
the factors involved, interact with potential participants and with all this information to be able to
present them the feasible solutions through which you can achieve your main goals.

## What do we do it for?

The fact that a client can give us the opportunity to listen to their needs together with the benefit of presenting and executing the solution represents only a fraction of the "Why do it? We are driven to establish a long term relationship through which we can accompany our clients in the situations that arise, of course, as long as it is under our expertise and field of action.

**There are two (2) ways on how to do each and every one of our activities as professionals: Well or Badlyâ€¦.. We do them excellently**
